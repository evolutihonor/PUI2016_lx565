Comment:
Richard's graph is related to recent classwork, line fitting. He ploted a fitted line to random data. He has legend, labels, and title.

I feel Richard could make his graph better by using some real data instead artificial data. Then his graph will have real meaning.
Richard can also improve his graph by adding caption, which could explain what he plot.
In the legend, I would recommend him to put the fitted line equation, such as the coefficient and intercept.
