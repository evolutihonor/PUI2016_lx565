# Assignment 1:
The first assignment, I did it mostly by myself, but I asked Dongjie Fan about how to handle the ks test with two samples. 
He explained to me. 
# Assignment 2:
The second assignment, I did the first three questions with Jianghao Zhu while we were both in cusp studying, 
we discussed the notes from the class, looked at Professor's lab file, I also asked Yao Wang some coding questions 
while he was also in the cusp study room. I did the later questions mostly(90%) by myself, but i received help from Yao Wang for some polyfit questions. 





Formulate the Null hypothesis in words and in formulae for the 4 experiments below:

## Do diets help lose more fat than the exercise? 
Experimental setup: you have a test and a control sample.
### H0: The average fat level in the test sample population after diets within three months is less or same than the average fat level in the controled sample population after exercise within three month, singnificant level = 0.05.


## Do American trust the president?
POLL RESULTS: On May 16, 1994, Newsweek reported the results of a public opinion poll that asked: “From everything you know about 
Bill Clinton, does he have the honesty and integrity you expect in a president?” (p. 23). 
Poll surveyed 518 adults and 233, or 0.45 of them answered yes.
### H0: The percentage of surveyed adults answered yes to the poll is significantly higher or equal to the percentage of surveyed adults answered no, singnificant level = 0.05.

## Effectiveness of nicotine patches to quit smoking.
Experimental setup: measure cessation rates for smokers randomly assigned to use a nicotine patch versus a placebo patch.
### H0: The average of cessation rates for smoking for smokers use nicotine patch is significantly smaller or equal to the smokers who use placebo patch, significant level = 0.05


## Quantify the danger of smoking for pregnant women.
Experimemtal setup: measure IQ of children at ages 1, 2, 3, and 4 years of age.
### H0: The average IQ score of pregnant women's children at ages 1-4 is significantly higher or equal to average children IQ score.
significant level = 0.05
