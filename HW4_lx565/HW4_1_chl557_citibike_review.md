### a. Verify formatting of Null and Alternative Hypotheses

NULL HYPOTHESIS:
The ratio of man age under or equal to 25 years old to man age beyond 25 years old is same or higher than the ratio of woman age under or equal to 25 years old to woman age beyond 25 years old \n",

ALTERNERTIVE HYPOTHESIS:
The ratio of man age under or equal to 25 years old to man age beyond 25 years old is smaller than the ratio of woman age under or equal to 25 years old to woman age beyond 25 years old

From the above, The idea of null and alternative hypothese is correct. 

### b. Verify that the data supports the project 

The data supports the project. He did put age in woman and man in different group based on the age.

### c. Chose an appropriate test to test H0 given the type of data, and the question asked. 

I think Chi-square test should be good in this case, since it is used to compares observed frequencies to expected frequencies.
