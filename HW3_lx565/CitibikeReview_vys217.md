# Hey Le, 

## Please find below my comments:


# a) Verify the Null and alternative hypotheses 

The idea, null hypothesis and alternate hypothesis are unclear
## The idea as I understand from her given idea and hypotheses-
### Amongst the women, younger women(age <= 25) are more likely than youner men(age <= 25) amongst the men, to ride the citibike.

### In the hypothesis equations the ratio is taken as : ( young men/women(age<=25)) / ( old(age>25) men/women )
### I think, the ratio should be as follows: ( young men/women  ) / ( Total men/women ) - This would give more clear picture of the required idea 

### The dependant variable should be included. Time should be used in the hypothesis. 

### The Null and Alternate Hypothesis can be improved as per above comments

# b) Verify that the data supports the project: i.e. if the a data has the appropriate features (variables) to answer the question, and if the data was properly pre-processed to extract the needed values (there is some flexibility here since the test was not chosen yet)

## The data(columns) used is correct, however, I have following comments - 
### The dataframe created does not have the correct column labels.
### Maybe a plot by age group(young/old men/women) would be appropriate


# c) Chose an appropriate test to test H0 given the type of data, and the question asked. 

### The ANOVA test can be used. The independant variables are proportions - categorical, (young & old) The dependant variable time
