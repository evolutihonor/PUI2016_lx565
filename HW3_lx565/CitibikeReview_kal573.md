### Analysis of Hypothesis:

I would rewrite the null hypothesis to be more clear to readers:

The ratio of men age 25 or younger to men older than 25 is same or higher than the ratio of women age 25 or younger to women older than 25.

The hypothesis equation is set up correctly.

### Data Analysis:

The type of data used in this hypothesis is birth year (integers, continuous), male/female riders (categorical), and number of rides (continuous).  Therefore, an appropriate statistical test would be a T-test.

A T-test would be appropriate because it it primarily used to look at the difference between two groups (here, male/female riders) on some variable of interest (number of rides by age group).
